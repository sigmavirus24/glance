fixes:
  - Image member names were previously not checked when adding an image member 
    to an image. As a result, Glance did not handle an exception triggered by 
    the database when the length of the image member name exceeded the maximum 
    length that the column type allowed which resulted in a 500 response. By 
    validating the length of an image member name, Glance now avoids a 500 
    error and instead returns a 400 error
